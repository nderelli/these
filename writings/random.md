What trait, above most all others, has allowed human beings to flourish? To increase our potential? To progress? To be content? 

The ability to learn has played perhaps the most important role

I propose that above all else, _education_ has been key.

Designer and writer Frank Chimero once posted to his website a response to the question, "What advice would you give to a graphic design student?" I read this as a freshman in the Visual Communication Design program at Arizona State University. One line in particular resonated with me.

> "Patina is a pretty word, and a beautiful concept"
> <cite>Frank Chimero</cite>

At first I had no bearing on the words meaning. As I've found reading definitions as a means of gaining knowledge is rather boring, I had to see it to understand it. And then I saw it in everything. The change in expression of form over time due to natural patterns. That's how I would more or less describe it. 

In one of nature's wonderful *cannot unlearn* moments, I changed how I looked at common ideas. I see patina as the embodiment of honesty in nature. Beauty in the reaction to extracorporeal forces. 

The key in all of these situations is _time_. Everything develops in seemingly infinite succession of moments. Little individual glimpses of the entire picture of humanity. I only know what I know. I can only struggle to remain on top and open to the layers of human experience on which mine has so obviously been built. 

Our relation to modern technology is one of ridiculous complexity. The refinement and complexification of tools has led us to a point that no individual could know everything. In a computer, each individual component could be someone's life's work. Thought seems recursive to me. By this I only mean insofar as everything can be continually broken down (or even theoretically broken down). -Humans are just so fucking stupid that we will reduce our existence to developing the most meaningless of components.- If you are making tools, which I consider the most humanitarian of actions, you -have to- make sure that your tools function can be extended. Not in the form of pointless add-ons and components that reduce the meaning of the object itself, but that it enables other humans to work with it in new contexts. Context-specific tools are not tools that last. 


### Hold up— that's a big statement. 

- What is education? 
- How does one measure it? 
- Are their standards? 
- Who enforces those standards?

### To define is to limit. -Oscar Wilde

### Describe Education

Education is not synonymous with school.
Tech Reform is not Education reform
A reaction to the unknown
The result of discovery
The process of discovery



#### The Problem?
Every factor of someone's life plays a role. 
Teachers, technology, cultural context, socioeconomic context

Teachers, technology: The two are incredibly and inextricably linked.

> Over the last thirteen years since NCLB the American education system has shifted away from the broad goal of preparing students for life, to the specific goal of preparing students for college. -Paul Smith, Head of Marketing, Learnsprout, former fourth-grade teacher

> "Kids aren't learning because we as educators are not doing our job. A bunch of people think because of poverty and crime and drugs" [children can't learn]. That makes it tougher, but it doesn't mean you just give up, he said. "You don't have a doctor who says, 'I deal with colds, but if you've got heart problems, you're just going to die.'" Geoffrey Canada

### Missed Opportunity

> In our country, we've allowed some communities to become toxic for children. These are places where the schools don't work and young people don't feel safe. There's crime, drugs, and violence in the streets and often in children's homes. Without real support in a community, the kids who don't go to a "good" school will end up in trouble with really negative outcomes. -Geoffrey Canada

### Creativity

> "Original ideas with value" -Ken Robinson

I think this is true; but how can this be incorporated into the Public Education system? Can this be taught?

Creativity is a _context_, a response to an infinite number of factors. Way of thinking, tools available, emotion, engagement, productivity, etc.

The classroom is the place to explore these contexts. 

The role of the teacher is to make an environment





> Examples of the different kinds of thinking are: sequencing and ordering information, sorting, classifying, grouping, analyzing, identifying part/whole relationships, comparing and contrasting; making predictions and hypothesizing; drawing conclusions, giving reasons for conclusions; distinguishing fact from opinion; determining bias and checking the reliability of evidence; generating new ideas and brainstorming; relating cause and effect, designing a fair test; defining and clarifying problems, thinking up different solutions, setting up goals and sub-goals; testing solutions and evaluating outcomes; planning and monitoring progress towards a goal, revising plans; making decisions, setting priorities, weighing up pros and cons.

Education from the students perspective
what does a student want? What is the goal of Public Education? 


Entire student's lives are spent in education, I'm asking to reconsider what we've been apart of our whole lives.

[Nikhil Goyal, review of school](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ericaswallow/2012/09/05/american-education-system-nikhil-goyal/)

> Goyal upholds that education is about _examination, interrogation, investigation_. From childhood to adulthood, **we should be filled with joy when we learn**. We should seek out opportunities to tinker and debate, to learn about the world around us.
> Instead, we are forced to sit at desks, shut up, listen, and raise our hands to speak. By the time we make it out of high school, Goyal says, we have been taught to think just like everyone around us, and our ability to think critically or creatively has been squandered. What’s worse, we fail to ask questions and we fear risks, because all of our formidable years were spent spitting out “right answers” instead of being taught to inquire and think for ourselves to solve problems.

A 2011 study estimated that parenting (e.g. maternal sensitivity, reading, extracurricular activities, setting expectations) explains 40 percent of the cognitive gap between children at age four -- more than any other factor.
