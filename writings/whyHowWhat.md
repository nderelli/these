## What/How/Why
From A TEDx talk by Simon Sinek. Three concentric circles are the 'Golden Circle.' The outermost circle is _what_, and going inward, next is _how_, and finally _why_ is at the core.

The basis of the talk is that most communication takes place from the outside in ( _what, how, why_ ). Sinek argues that this is contradictory to great leaders such as Apple Inc., Martin Luther King, Jr., and the Wright Brothers.

> People don't buy _what_ you do, people buy _why_ you do it. 
> _What_ you do is proof of what you believe ( _why_ ).
> Be driven by a cause.

### Morals

“To be good is to be in harmony with one’s self,” he replied, touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale, fine-pointed fingers. “Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One’s own life—that is the important thing. As for the lives of one’s neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one’s moral views about them, but they are not one’s concern. Besides, Individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one’s age. I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality.” _The Picture of Dorian Gray_ Chapter Six Oscar Wilde
“There is no sin except stupidity.” Oscar Wilde

### Ideas

“An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all.” Oscar Wilde
“The only good thing to do with good advice is pass it on; it is never of any use to oneself.” Oscar Wilde
