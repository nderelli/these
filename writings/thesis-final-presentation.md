# Why does the education system fail to align with our expections?

Learning: The acquisition of knowledge or skills through experience, study, or by being taught.

## Educational Foundations

- [The Value of Education](http://www.globalpartnership.org/who-we-are/the-value-of-education/)

Ask the audience why they think *learning* is important. It's a ridiculously difficult question to answer.

The ability to learn is perhaps the most important ability that human beings have developed for our survival, and our progress as a species.

Learning is the foundation of progress.
*What is learning?*
Learning is a constant, active process.

So learning is fantastic, but how does that differ from education? I would say that *Education* is the measurable expression of learning. Notice the word measure— I'll return to that in just a moment. But obviously the two go hand-in-hand. Learning and Education. The former is an active process, the latter a measurable result. 

Education is an **actual** solution to a multitude of problems. Consider this quote from poet/artist/teacher/punk-god Henry Rollins. 

> Education. Education is the way out. It would solve everything from income disparity, to even having an argument about marriage equality; Your prisons would empty; domestic violence would plummet; transfer of STDs from one young person to another would fall off the radar; America would be the skinny Elvis for the rest of the world, because you have this country full of switched on, very funny, very helpful, incredibly wonderful people, which we are already, but with an intellectual upgrade across the board. The fact that America is not number one in literacy should be the albatross that hangs around america's collective neck. I'll debate anyone on this, and I'll win.
> <cite>Henry Rollins {% cite rollinsInterview %}</cite>

- Happiness stems from actively changing/improving one's reality/environment.
- A prerequisite is both knowing that one can do so, and knowing how to do so autonomously.
- Education is an equalizer of gender, race, etc.
- Education fosters human potential
- Education promotes peace.
- Education reduces poverty.

#### Slide Idea

Put up information from [this link](http://www.globalpartnership.org/who-we-are/the-value-of-education/) that shows concrete research of the benefits of education in social areas.

## Ask about school

Think back to your time in school. What stands out? What do you remember? What was important for you to learn?

*Crickets*

For most people with whom I spoke, there wasn't much to say. Why is this an issue? -Because Education is the measurable expression of learning.- The public education system in the United States, which is guaranteed but not obligatory, is ideally the reflection of the value that we place in learning.


## State of Public Schools

- [Source](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=372)
- 2010–11: 13,600 public school districts
- 2010–11: 98,800 public schools, 5,300 charter schools
- 2011–12: 30,900 private schools offering kindergarten or higher grades
- 2013: ~ 50.1 million students will attend public elementary and secondary schools
- 35.3 million K-8
- More K-8 students entering than ever before.
- 14.8 million 9-12
- Current expenditures for public elementary and secondary schools are projected to be $591 billion for the 2013–14 school year
- The current expenditure per student is projected at $11,810 for this school year 


### Failure to Align

This is a **massive** system. Any change is difficult, and directly affects millions of people. But why is there a need for change?

- Two out of three eighth-graders can’t read proficiently. (NAEP, 2011)
- Nearly two-thirds of eighth-graders scored below proficient in math.
- **Seventy-five percent of students are not proficient in civics. (NAEP, 2011)**
- Nearly three out of four eighth- and 12th-grade students cannot write proficiently. (NAEP, 2012)
- For African-American and Hispanic students across the country, dropout rates are close to 40 percent, compared to the national average of 27 percent. (EPE, 2012)

- Only one in four high school students graduate ready for college in all four core subjects (English, reading, math and science), which is why a third of students entering college have to take remedial courses. (ACT, 2011)
- Only 4 percent of African American students and 11 percent of Hispanic students finish high school ready for college in their core subjects. (ACT, 2011)
- Two-thirds of college professors report that what is taught in high school does not prepare students for college. (Alliance for Excellent Education)
-  In Finland, for example, 24 percent were top performers in at least one subject and 7.4 percent were top performers in all three; in Japan, 30 percent were top performers in at least one subject and 11.3 percent in all three; and in Canada, 21.9 percent were top performers in at least one subject and 6.5 percent in all three. In the U.S., 12 percent of students were top performers in at least one subject and 4.7 percent were top performers in all three.

- After World War II, the United States had the #1 high school graduation rate in the world. Today, we have dropped to # 22 among 27 industrialized nations. (OECD, 2012)
- American students rank 25th in math, 17th in science and 14th in reading compared to students in 27 industrialized countries.(OECD, 2012)
- By the end of the eighth grade, U.S. students are two years behind in math compared to their peers in other countries. (OECD, 2009)
- The U.S. ranks behind 13 other countries in terms of the percentage of 25- to 34-year-olds who have completed some college coursework. (OECD, 2012)
- American students tend to perform worse in math and science as they age, according to recent studies measuring fourth- and eighth-graders' academic achievement against other industrialized nations. Gaps with high performing countries like South Korea and Singapore are widening. (TIMSS, 2012)

- Public schools in other countries are more of a lever for social mobility that help children of all backgrounds realize their potential than they are in the U.S. (OECD, June, Education at a Glance, 2012)

Cognitive psychologist Edward De Bono (who coined the term 'lateral thinking') describes our education system as based on three main concepts. {% cite de2006bono %}

- Analysis: Specific, in-depth study
- Judgement: Any decision based on second-hand knowledge
- Argument: (Bad term) Presenting information from analysis and judgement.

Unfortunately, this model does not address:

- Generative
- Productive
- Creative
- Design

All of which are integral to human development.



## We've Over-standardized

Remember I said that I'd get back to the concept of measurement? In a system of this size, measurement of learning is vital. Unfortunately, it has become the driving force behind the system. Test results are now the end goal, negating the benefits of process in the learning experience. 

Ask yourself-- is this enough. 


## Campaigns

The goal is to free the potential of each person, allowing him or herself to navigate the world in a way that is individually fufilling, and to make connections beyond the obvious. 

### STE(A)M + Open Source Curriculum

Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics + Art & Design

### Never miss an opportunity to teach

*Target audience: Teachers, Parents*

Awareness campaign encouraging teachers, parents, and students to actively learn from and teach one another. 

When I was young, I can remember being in the car with my parents. As we were accelerating out of a stop, I took a sip of water from a water bottle. I spilled 


### Seperating subjects

Modularity is paramount when working with complex systems. For the Public Education system, in its near boundless complexity, developing a system of standards for curriculum and measurement is *necessary*.
