> We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.
> <cite>R. Buckminster Fuller</cite>

> Education is the kindling of a flame, not the filling of a vessel.

> Although I do not, with some enthusiasts, believe that the human condition will ever advance to such a state of perfection as that there shall no longer be pain or vice in the world, yet I believe it susceptible of much improvement, and most of all in matters of government and religion; and that the diffusion of knowledge among the people is to be the instrument by which it is to be effected.
> <cite>Thomas Jefferson</cite> to Pierre Samuel Dupont de Nemours, 1816. ME 14:491

> And in my opinion, the solution that would work to fight all these wars and all these problems that people are facing is only education.

> Because you can stop war for a second, but you don’t know it will start again or not, we have seen first world war, we have seen second world war and I think third world war is coming, but I believe that we must stop it now.

> I don’t want to see a third world war in this world again and the best way to fight against this war is education, because as we can see, the children are suffering from terrorism, they are suffering from child labor and child trafficking, they’re also suffering from the culture norms and traditions, there is not only one issue that we are facing to, there are many others as well, so I think education is the best way.

> **People will be _thinking_, just going to school learning about chemistry and physics and math and that’s it. Going to school is not only learning about different subjects, it teaches you communication, it teaches you how to live a life, it teaches you about history, it teaches you about how science is working. And other than that, you learn about equality because students are provided the same benches, they sit equally, it shows us equality, it teaches students how to live with others together, how to accept each other’s language, how to accept each other’s traditions and each other’s religion. It also teaches us justice, it also teaches us respect, it teaches us how to live together, so that’s why I support the idea of sending children to school because it is the best way to fight terrorism.** 

> And I want people to support us in this cause and through Malala Foundation we want to work for education of girls in the developing countries, especially in Syria now, they are suffering, they are homeless now. We want to help children in Afghanistan because they have been suffering from terrorism for decades, we want to help the children of India as well because they are victims of child labor, so I think issues and problems are enormous, but the solution is one and it is simple, that is education.
> <cite>Malala Yousafzai</cite>

> Education. Education is the way out. It would solve everything from income disparity, to even having an argument about marriage equality. Your prisons would empty; domestic violence would plummet; transfer of STDs from one young person to another would fall off the radar; America would be the skinny Elvis for the rest of the world, because you have this country full of switched on, very funny, very helpful, incredibly wonderful people, which we are already, but with an intellectual upgrade across the board. The fact that America is not number one in literacy should be the albatross that hangs around america's collective neck. I'll debate anyone on this, and I'll win.
> <cite>Henry Rollins</cite>
