## What am I trying to say?

From my brief research, I've found that people don't really 'hold on' to the curriculum of public high schools.

Taking the concept of open-source seriously in the public education system. This encourages analysis, collaboration, iteration, and focuses on engaging with a system, instead of learning facts.

## What am I trying to convince people to do?

- Anyone can learn (Anything)
- Teach Anyone to Learn Anything
- How do *you* learn?
- Applying the design process / learning process to anything that you'd like.

## Where is my research?

**Andover Public Schools**

> For several years, she has partnered with the high school’s math department to teach “Geometry Through the Lens of Art,” a museum field trip in which students examine the ways that artistic perspectives and geometric concepts are inherently related. “At Andover High School, we want to give our students a full and complete education. We want them to be future ready,” Michaud says, and she believes that the integration of Art + Design into Science, Technology, Engineering and Math is the way to achieve those goals.

## Skating

Skating is one of the best examples of a learning process. At first, with few exceptions, everyone is terrible. I remember becoming frustrated beyond belief. 

Can I show the correlations between skating and process-based learning?
