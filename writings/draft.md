There is always richer data. 
There are always more insightful thoughts.
There is never another opportunity.

## Dedication

For Jean Boatman.

## Front Matter

Set the tone for the book, I'm talking about really getting someone to understand that Education is an important issue. I have reservations as to whether this is a valid approach. Don't most people understand that when it comes to solving problems, all roads lead to Education? 

So most people know that learning is important. It is not within the scope of this project to explain why learning is important, or why schools are important.

My research started with teachers, and grew to schools, states, national standards and approaches, and it all ultimately came down to the student's mindset. 

-The problems of education increase exponentially with every human involved.- 


## Preconceptions, or, an anecdotal and uninformed foray into the problems of public education.

When it comes to education, we're all in the same boat. Not in that all educational opportunity is strictly equal, but in the way that nearly all human beings _can_ learn.


## Education, Globally

Facts and data relating to the measurement of education and educational institutions around the world.

The current constraints of human consciousness limiting me to a single body. I can only experience education as a white man in the United States, namely a suburban area of San Francisco and Phoenix.

Break down the state of global education. What data is important to have on each page?

Finland, Japan, China, United States provide examples of variations within the educational system.

### Finland

#### Pasi Sahlberg

>	Pasi Sahlberg is Finnish educator and scholar. He worked as schoolteacher, teacher educator and policy advisor in Finland and has studied education systems and reforms around the world. His expertise includes international educational change, future of schooling, and innovation in teaching and learning. His best-seller book “Finnish Lessons: What can the world learn from educational change in Finland” (Teachers College Press, 2011) won the 2013 Grawemeyer Award. He is a former Director General of CIMO (Centre for International Mobility and Cooperation) in Helsinki and currently a visiting Professor of Practice at Harvard University’s Graduate School of Education in Cambridge, MA, USA.

> In Finland, we have put the principle of having a good public school for everybody, all the children, as a priority before trying to beat everybody else.
> <cite>Pasi Sahlberg</cite>

> Accountability is something that is left when responsibility is taken away. That's why in my country we speak much more about responsibility rather than accountability.
> <cite>Pasi Salberg</cite>

> [Finns understand] that standardization is the worst enemy of creativity and innovation in school.


##### Talent, Time, Technology

**Talent**

Imagination, using their minds for their own good.

> I have proposed that we should put finding everybody's talents as a first priority in the school, and the task, the call, of the education system.

The more we standardize education in our schools, the less this is likely to happen

**Time**

We need to rethink the notion of time in education.

'If we only had more time.'

**Technology**

There is no way back, children have better technology in their pockets and backpacks than any other time in history.

> We have to stop blaming teachers and schools for something that is beyond their control and reach. I think confrontation is not the solution.

None of these things are outside of our reach, whether we do this, or not, is a moral question. Our future depends on our action today.





## Education from the inside out.

I started thinking the problem of education was teachers. This conception led me to discover the standards imposed on teachers by administrators and local school boards. School boards manage funding allocated from the state, and as such make fiscal decisions that affect how teachers approach and manage their classrooms. The state is in charge of education, as it is not a concern of the federal government under the Constitution.

In order to remain competitive against global measurements of education, the federal government has become increasingly involved in the decisions made by states on matters of schooling. This is almost exclusively done through the allocation of federal dollars. States can opt in to federal programs (and funding) in exchange for accountability regarding those programs. 

As one zooms out of the picture ultimately focused on the individual student, the complexity becomes overwhelming. What started as a beautiful picture of human development has evolved into a picture rife with noise and external influence. The individual potential of every student has now transformed; Their potential is no longer the goal. 

The goal has become the measurement, the students and their lives are merely a tool to compare. When the measured goals of student achievement are met, credit is taken by every step of the ladder. Teachers are (sometimes) rewarded for their effectiveness. Administrators cite their work in staff development. Board members take pride in their making responsible decisions regarding personnel and allocating funds. States revel in how their programs and education reform policy is the true reason for success.

There are so many cogs in the institutional machine of Public Education, that at this point the failure of Public Education in the United States to meet our societal expectations cannot be placed at a single source. The first part of researching my topic was spent moving up this chain starting with a student, looking to see where things went wrong. 

With each level of abstraction from the measured source, additional factors become overbearing and clutter the pristine picture of a student with which we started.

This is the problem.

## Mindset

Psychologist Carol Dweck has extensively researched the idea of mindset. In her book titled _Mindset_, Dweck describes two basic mindsets held by people regarding education and intelligence.

> If you're a teacher, remember that lowering standards doesn't raise students' self esteem. But neither does raising standards without giving students ways of reaching them. The growth mindset gives you a way to set high standards and have students reach them. Try presenting topics in a growth framework and giving students process feedback. I think you'll like what happens.

> As parents, teachers, and coaches, our mission is developing people's potential. Let's use all the lessons of the growth mindset— and whatever else we can— to do this.

#### Fixed Mindset

Intelligence in static.

Leads to a desire to look smart and therefore a tendency to...

- …**Avoid challenges**
- …**Give up easily**
- …**see effort as fruitless**
- …**Ignore useful negative feedback**
- …**Feel threatened by the success of others**

As a result, they may plateau early
and achieve less than their full potential.

All this confirms a deterministic view of the world.

#### Growth Mindset

Intelligence can be developed.

Leads to a desire to learn and therefore a tendency to…

- …**Embrace challenges:**
- …**Persist in the face of setbacks**
- …**See effort as the path to mastery**
- …**Learn from criticism**
- …**Find lessons and inspiration in the success of others**

All this gives them a greater sense of free will.


### It all comes back to, well, you.

As the complexity of the educational system, the burden of measurement, and any number of other factors affecting the journey of a student through public education in the United States slowly revealed themselves, I found myself ever-increasingly confused. There was always another step up the ladder, another party demanding accountability over responsibility.
